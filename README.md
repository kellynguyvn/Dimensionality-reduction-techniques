# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
## Learning Objectives
1) Wrote a colab for dimensionality reduction techniques for various data setsb). The colab covers cases where it works and where it does not works. The colab includes <br>
a) PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE <br>
b) UMAP and t-sne <br>
Do proper visualization as well as techniques showcasing selecting the hyperparameter. Use UMAP visualizer and provide screenshots

3) Wrote a colab to illustrate how dimensionality reduction technique like umap can be used followed by clustering. (see slide show in clustering) as well as a classification feature extraction technique
